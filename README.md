### Hi there, we're [LLGroup](https://liang-seu.net/)!:wave:
We are from the [School of Information Science and Engineering](https://radio.seu.edu.cn/), [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/), China, and we do research in wireless communications, signal processing, and machine learning. 

> There's only one corner of the universe you can be sure of improving, and that's your own self.

ðŸš–**Our current focus is on the theory and application of intelligent wireless systems, including**:

- Intelligent radio resource management (e.g. **Resource allocation in cellular/V2X/Wi-Fi networks**)
- Machine learning over wireless networks (e.g. **Collaborative perception for autonomous driving**)
- Learning-based communication and signal processing (e.g. **Goal-oriented/semantic communications and MIMO**)

```
The tools we frequently use include deep/reinforcement/federated learning, graph neural network and optimization.
```

ðŸ“£**As for students, we're now looking for**:
- Highly motivated students with solid mathematics and coding background
- Interested in machine learning and wireless communications in general
- Passionate about life and scientific research

```
We have 1-2 Ph.D. and 3-4 Master's opening each year. Please drop us an email if you're interested in joining us.
