### Hi there, we're [LLGroup](https://liang-seu.net/)!:wave:
We are from [School of Information Science and Technology](https://radio.seu.edu.cn/main.htm), [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/), China.

Information about the mentor of our group is as follows：

> [Le Liang](https://radio.seu.edu.cn/2021/0611/c19937a374738/page.htm) is a Professor in the School of Information Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China. He received the B.E. degree in information engineering from Southeast University in 2012, the M.A.Sc degree in electrical engineering from the University of Victoria, Canada, in 2015, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology, USA, in 2018. From 2019 to 2021, he was a Research Scientist at Intel Labs, Hillsboro, USA. His main research interests are in wireless communications, signal processing, and machine learning.

🖥️:**Research-wise, we mainly focus on**:

- Radio resource management(e.g. **Resource allocation in cellular/V2X/Wi-Fi networks**)
- Machine learning over wireless networks(e.g. **Collaborative perception for autonomous driving**)
- Learning-based communication and signal processing(e.g. **Goal-oriented communications and MIMO**)

`
I am looking for highly motivated students with solid mathematics and coding background, who are interested in machine learning and wireless communications in general.
