### Hi there, we're [LLGroup](https://liang-seu.net/)!:wave:
We are from [School of Information Science and Technology](https://radio.seu.edu.cn/main.htm), [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/), China.

Information about the PIï¼š

> [Le Liang](https://radio.seu.edu.cn/2021/0611/c19937a374738/page.htm) is a Professor in the School of Information Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China. He received the B.E. degree in information engineering from Southeast University in 2012, the M.A.Sc degree in electrical engineering from the University of Victoria, Canada, in 2015, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology, USA, in 2018. From 2019 to 2021, he was a Research Scientist at Intel Labs, Hillsboro, USA. His main research interests are in wireless communications, signal processing, and machine learning.<br>Email: lliang@seu.edu.cn

ðŸš–**Our current research emphasis is on the theory and application of intelligent wireless systems, including**:

- Intelligent radio resource management (e.g. **Resource allocation in cellular/V2X/Wi-Fi networks**)
- Machine learning over wireless networks (e.g. **Collaborative perception for autonomous driving**)
- Learning-based communication and signal processing (e.g. **Goal-oriented/semantic communications and MIMO**)

The tools we frequently use in research include deep/reinforcement/federated learning, graph neural networks, variational inference/MCMC, and optimization

ðŸ“£**As for students, we're now looking for**:
- Highly motivated students with solid mathematics and coding background
- Interested in machine learning and wireless communications in general
- Passionate about life and scientific research

```
We usually have 1-2 Ph.D. and 3-4 Master's openings every year. Please drop us an email if you're interested in our group.
