### Hi there, we're [LLGroup](https://liang-seu.net/)!:wave:
We are a research group lead by [Professor Le Liang](https://liang-seu.net/) from the School of Information Science and Engineering, [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/), Nanjing, China, and we do research in wireless communications, signal processing, and machine learning. 
Our current focus is on the theory and application of intelligent wireless systems, including:
- Learning-based communication signal processing (e.g., learning-driven MIMO receiver design)
- Intelligent radio resource management (e.g., resource allocation in cellular/V2X/Wi-Fi networks)
- Machine learning over wireless network (e.g., federated learning, collaborative perception for autonomous driving)

```
To have an idea on what we do on a day-to-day basis, the tools we frequently use in research include
- Deep learning, reinforcement learning, graph neural networks, variational inference, MCMC
- Communication theory, optimization theory, probability theory, linear algebra
- Python, PyTorch, MATLAB, and (a bit of) C++
```

ðŸ“£**As for students, we're now looking for**:
- Highly motivated students with solid mathematics and coding background
- Interested in machine learning and wireless communications in general
- Passionate about life and scientific research

```
We have 1-2 Ph.D. and 3-4 Master's opening each year. Please drop us an email (lliang@seu.edu.cn) if you're interested in joining us.
